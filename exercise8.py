# Expected Output
# 1 
# 2 2 
# 3 3 3 
# 4 4 4 4 
# 5 5 5 5 5
# define a for loop with a range of 1 to 6
for i in range(1, 6):
# for each iteration, convert the iteraton to str 
    converted_num_to_str = str(i)
# and print based on the number of that iteration
    print(converted_num_to_str * i)


# Done!!
